# Blog 

This blog was started to document my open source 
contributions. The changes are documented in the
projects themselves, but redisplayed here too, 
as it is easier to view them in one place.

# SWARMBJECT 

High level programming language and 
graphical development environment.

## About menu 

Before this commit, upon starting the application, 
a welcoming text and the license were displayed in 
the area designated for code editing, and 
disappeared upon opening a file. Now the 
application starts by displaying them in a newly 
added about menu. This fixes the issue of having 
an empty top bar at the beginning (since it 
contains the opened file's path, but there is no 
file opened yet), and also makes it possible to 
redisplay this information, without having to 
reopen the application.

# Lexikonarium 

Lexikonarium is about creating dictionaries 
for self learning purposes.

## About menu 

Just like with the SWARMBJECT project, an about 
menu was added here too for the same benefits. 
(Previously they were displayed in the area 
designated for displaying the dictionary meanings.)

## Labels 

Previously the meaning and text areas were 
unlabeled, maximizing screen space, but being user 
unfriendly, by having to know where they are 
without a visual guide. Now they are labeled.

# Support 

Support is always well appreciated, either by 
spreading the word, or by generous donations.
Current goal is to make full time open source 
developer status a possibility. For details 
please read [/docs/support.md](support.md).
Thank you.
